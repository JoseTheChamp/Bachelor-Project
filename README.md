3. Options to customize output. (folder structure etc.)
4. Safety measures (No saving passwords/own solution)
5. Website as a interface for human input.

## Phases of development

### First Phase : Testing components and libraries

In the first phase i would test how to work with reddit API and what it takes to download gathered content. Results would be small one purpuse demo's to ensure everything works as imagined.

### Second phase : Offline version of software
In this version one would be able to automaticly download all saved posts in customizable manner. Service would run locally on one's computer. Support for windows is priority, but would prefer to inluce macOS, Android and IOS.

### Third phase : Online service
More consideration needed.
