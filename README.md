# Bachelor project
 My bachelor project for University.

 ## General info

 My project aims to make reddit downloader of a kind. Essentially combine functions of Reddit Manager with JDownloader.
 
 
 1. Reddit Manager : https://redditmanager.com 
 2. JDownloader : https://jdownloader.org/home/index

 Reddit manager is tool for managment of saved posts on reddit.
 Jdownloader is free open-source download managment tool.


## Phases of development

### First Phase : Testing components and libraries

    In the first phase i would test how to work with reddit API and what it takes to download gathered content. Results would be small one purpuse demo's to ensure everything works as imagined.

### Second phase : Offline version of software
    In this version one would be able to automaticly download all saved posts in customizable manner. Service would run locally on one's computer. Support for windows is priority, but would prefer to inluce macOS, Android and IOS.

### Third phase : Online service
    More consideration needed.
